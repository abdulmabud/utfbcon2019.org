        <h2>Welcome to Bangladesh</h2>
        <p>Bangladesh is south Asia's greenest jewel – a country braided with rivers, with a rich culture waiting to be
            explored by pioneering travellers.</p>

        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">A Land of Rivers </span> <br>
            Welcome to river country. Bangladesh is braided together by more than 700 rivers, producing a deliciously
            lush
            landscape with more shades of green than you ever imagined. Travelling by boat is a way of life here, and
            provides a fabulous opportunity to see the country from a more unusual angle.</p>

        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Hidden Riches </span> <br>
            The mangrove forests and tigers of the Sundarbans National Park are Bangladesh's most famous attraction, but
            the
            country has a host of lesser-known attractions that are waiting to be discovered. Highlights include the
            Buddhist remains at Paharpur and the 15th-century mosques and mausoleums of Bagerhat, both of which are
            Unesco
            World Heritage Sites. </p>

        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Warm & Welcoming </span> <br>
            Getting off the beaten track is something of a travel cliché these days, but Bangladesh is somewhere that
            tourism remains in its infancy. It's easy to get the sensation that you're breaking ground here, even if
            your
            pioneering spirit is frequently attended to by being the centre of attention. Bangla culture is famously
            welcoming – rarely will you have cause to suspect the ulterior motives that can sometimes bedevil travel in
            other parts of south Asia.</p>

            <div class="col-6">
                <p>Dhaka is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. With its colorfoul history and rich cultural
                    traditions, Dhaka is known the world over as the city of mosques and muslin. Its fame attracted
                    travellers from far and near throughout the ages. Today it has grown into a mega city of about 16
                    million people, with an area of about 1353 sq. km. becoming the hub of the nation’s industrial,
                    commercial, cultural, educational and political activities.</p>

                <p>The highlight of any visit to Dhaka is to take in a serving of the pulsing vibrancy and extraordinary
                    atmosphere of Puran Dhaka (Old Dhaka). With its winding alleyways and frenetic buzzing energy, there
                    is something to see around every corner and a walk here proves to be quite the photographer’s
                    delight. Travel by a horse driven cart or rickshaw along busy Dhaka streets is a rewarding
                    experience.</p>

                        Cox’s Bazar
                        The main reason to come to Cox’s Bazar is for the beach. It’s a very long, very exposed stretch
                        of sand, rather than a picturesque tropical-island type of affair. It's fun for a quick paddle,
                        though, and there are sun loungers and umbrellas you can rent (from Tk 10). The main attraction,
                        though, is being able to take lazy sunset walks along the sand. There is also a handful of
                        decent beach cafes.

                        Ratargul
                        About 35km northwest of Sylhet lies Ratargul, Bangladesh's only freshwater swamp forest, formed
                        by the spilling over of the Gowain River into a 200-hectare jungle basin shaded by innumerable
                        evergreens. A variety of trees, including the readily recognisable millettia or koroch, stand
                        with their trunks immersed in water and provide refuge to bird species such as kingfishers,
                        cormorants, cranes and herons, as well as a large assortment of snakes.

                        Chittagong Hill Tracts
                        Decidedly untypical of Bangladesh, both in topography and culture, this largely Buddhist Adivasi
                        (tribal) stronghold is the homeland of the Jumma people. It's a stunning region of hills,
                        ravines and cliffs covered with dense jungles of bamboo, creepers and shrubs, and dotted with
                        tall, slender waterfalls.

                        Sundarbans National Park
                        A shroud of mystery and danger looms over the Unesco-protected Sundarbans National Park, the
                        largest mangrove forest in the world. Bleak and haunting at the same time, the wilderness here
                        comprises an enormous network of interconnected waterways, stretching inland for about 80km from
                        the Bay of Bengal. This is truly wild terrain, and a three- or four-day boat trip into the heart
                        of this magnificent part of south Asia often ranks as the chief highlight of a trip to
                        Bangladesh.
